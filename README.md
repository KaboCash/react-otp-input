### React-OTP Component

This is a highly customizable React JS component that you use within your project to enable OTP Code submissions.

## INSTALLATION STEPS

> Please note that this component does not make use of any external library and this means that you can literally copy these files `otpInputs.js` && `otpInputs.module.css` into your project and you're good to go

After cloning the repo or downloading the source code, run `npm install` to install all dependencies.

```bash
$ npm install
```

When the dependencies are installed, and you encounter a babel error, run the command below to resolve this error

```bash
$ npm install --save-dev @babel/plugin-proposal-private-property-in-object --legacy-peer-deps
```

Now Fire up your server ðŸ”¥

```bash
$ npm run start
```

Visit the server at `http://localhost:3000` to view the app

## CONFIGURATION

- From `v1.1`, `autoSubmit` is configurable when you call the component `<OTPInputGroup autoSubmit={false} />`. 
  - If you set this prop to `true`, the form will call the submit function once all boxes has been filled, otherwise, you need to hit the submit button for the form to be submitted.

- This simple app supports both Numbers and Letters. 
  - If you need only numbers or letters, be sure to modify it to suit your project.
